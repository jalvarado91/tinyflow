# TinyFlow 

Hello ðŸ‘‹! TinyFlow is a tiny distributed workflow implementation. It lets you create a DAG of tasks which can only start once all dependecies have completed successfully. 

Tasks are simply containers that run a process and exit when completed successfully.

### Deploying

You'll need a railway project, a railway API token, and some tasks you'd like to run. 
In your railway project you'll need a MongoDb service running. That's the only dependency. Give your service an external URL and go through the onboarding details.

TinyFlow can live in the same project where the resources will be deployed to, or it can reference a different project. At this time, a TinyFlow deployment only supports one project, so I recommend putting in in the same railway project where the resources will be.

You can also try my instance at https://tinyflow.up.railway.app


### About Tasks
I have setup some task containers, built with Nixpacks as seen in the sample above.
